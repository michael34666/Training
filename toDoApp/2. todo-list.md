# To Do List

---

In this project, we will be building a To Do List application using React. We will be using TypeScript, React hooks, and styling with flex box or React Bootstrap to create an organized and clean user interface.

## Tasks

- Can add tasks to the list.
- Can delete tasks from the list.
- Can mark tasks as completed.
- Show number of uncompleted task in the title.
- The list should be scrollable.

!!! Note "Important Notes"

    - Use eslint and prettier.//debug tool
    - Use TypeScript and React
    - Use hooks, such as useState //to save state and keep going
     and useEffect.// synchroniz the componenet with external system
    - Use react icons for the complete button and for the delete button. 
    - Use flex box, and if you want, you can use React Bootstrap.
    - The UI doesn't have to look exactly reference image, but it should still look organized and clean.
    - Don't forget to use git and save the code in a remote repository.
